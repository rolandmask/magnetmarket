## Build and run it Yourself

1. Download or clone the repo - https://github.com/rolandmask/magnetmarket

2. In the main directory run:
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
3. Run the site on localhost:
   ```shell
   npm start
   ```
4. Or run build process and upload build folder to server:
   ```shell
   npm run build
   ```
   If you upload to subfolder and not the main directory of your server then index.html inside the build folder needs the same subfoldername in front of linked filepaths in the file. <br> Example - /subfoldername/static/js/main.js instead of /static/js/main.js

**IMPORTANT: this is a test website not ready for production!**
